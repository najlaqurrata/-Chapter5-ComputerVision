# Chapter5-ComputerVision
In this project, I performed 2 tasks. Task 1 involves digital image processing in OpenCV2 to enhance image quality through techniques like pooling and CLAHE. And in Task 2, transfer learning is applied using pre-trained CNN models like ResNet, DenseNet, and ViT for multi-classification using deep learning-based computer vision methods.

### Task 1 : Digital Image Processing using OpenCV2
Implementation preprocessing digital image, increase the quality of image use method Pooling, and CLAHE.

### Task 2 : Transfer Learning using Torchvision Pre-trained CNN Models
Implementation method Transfer Learning for Multi-Classification use Deep Learning-Based Computer Vision Model, like ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT).


### What To Do :
Task 1, use a Max Pooling, Min Pooling, and Average Pooling operation for replicating the concept (brighten dark-toned photos), and then compare the results to another method, namely, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equation (CLAHE). 

Task 2, create a machine learning model using a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network to predictÂ image handwriting from MNIST, and freeze layers on (1) "denseblock1", (2) "denseblock1", and (3) "denseblock2". Retrain each model, plot its performance, and compare the results. And, as a bonus, could you replicate all of the steps listed above with different models, such as ResNet and ViT?
